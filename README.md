To run this code:

```pip install -r requirements-embedding.txt```

Define the input files in the main function (in the last part of the code)

```python xEnd.py```

output csv file will be generated in a folder named "workspace"

Everything that needs to be tweaked, can be done from the main function itself (modular approcah)
